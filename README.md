# RRG

RRG is a statistical reporting system. 
--------------------------------------

It can do summary statistics and some common statistical analyses (ancova, chisq, fisher, cmh, binomial, exact binomial and some others).

The core of RRG consists of SAS(R) macros which are 
distributed with `/store` option to allow for easy compilation.
The "companion" product is 
[Sasshiato](https://github.com/ipeszek/sasshiato), 
a java-based suite of programs to create RTF and/or PDF files, relieving RRG users of tedious tasks like calculating column widths.

You can add your own customized macros to accommodate your analysis needs.
  
Please refer to [RRG overview document](docs/RRG_overview_02Apr2019.pdf) for an overview of RRG.

The detailed documentation of RRG macro's parameters 
will be posted soon as comments in the source code.
