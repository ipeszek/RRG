rrg_addcond (grouping=y) with rrg_addgroup(across=y) may generate columns for null grouping var with all counts=0
  reason: merge of condcnt with condcnt_tmplt template results in empty groups
  solution: use codelist in rrg_addgroup
  
if user drops columns in rrg_codeafter, errro "index out of bound" occurs
  reason: __breakokat hvalues referring to columns no longer on dataset
  solution: drop or recreate __breakokat
